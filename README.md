# chess-game

MVC - Model-View-Controller Design Pattern

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the chess game, including the board state, pieces, and game rules.
View: Displays the current state of the game to the user and handles user input (e.g., moving pieces).
Controller: Manages the communication between the model and view, handling user input and updating the model accordingly.
